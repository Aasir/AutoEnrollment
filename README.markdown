	Features:
</h1>
<p>
	At this point, the program is only capable of signing up for a single class, given a hardcoded string of post parameters specific to that class.
	<br>
	The point of this script is to be able to bypass the waitlist for a class by jumping into it before the people in the waitlist are notified of the opening.
	** This is a proof of concept, not intended for actual use **
</p>
<h1>
	Future Updates:
</h1>
<p>
	Add the ability to have to script search for a class given the department, course number, section and semester
